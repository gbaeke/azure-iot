Note: skd.py uses the V2 API (see https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python)

If you use the ***generate code*** option in VS Code, the V1 SDK is used. On Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.9, that code does not run due to dependency issues. V1 is deprecated.

The Python SDK only supports MQTT (on 31/7/2020)

- supports symmetric key auth and X-509
